Overview:

This repository contains the source code for a Python-based Inventory Management and Sales Tracking System. The application provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for managing inventory, tracking sales, and analyzing trends. This project was started with the goal of fulfilling the needs of my client, who holds a senior role at a local 99 cents store, for my IB Computer Science SL internal assessment (components can be found in the following link: https://ib.compscihub.net/internal-assessment). However, this application can also be an ideal tool for other small business owners or individuals looking to streamline inventory and sales operations. The codebase for this project was written and developed in the Replit IDE, as suggested by my teacher.

Prerequisites:

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

•	Python 3.1 or later

•	The required Python libraries, which can be found in pyproject.toml and installed via pip
